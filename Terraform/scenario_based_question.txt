1.) You need to manage Dev, QA, and Prod across multiple AWS accounts with strict isolation.
How would you structure Terraform code, state backends, and providers?
What would you explicitly avoid (and why)?

2.) A teammate accidentally ran terraform apply in the wrong environment and caused an outage.
How would you:
Recover from this situation?
Prevent it from happening again?

3.) You inherit a Terraform repo where every module defines its own AWS provider with region and profile.
What problems can this cause, and how would you refactor it safely?

4.) Someone manually changed an AWS security group rule in the console.
Terraform now shows unexpected changes.
How do you:
Detect drift?
Decide whether to accept or override it?

5.) A Terraform plan includes database passwords.
How would you redesign this so that:
Secrets are not stored in state
CI/CD pipelines remain automated
